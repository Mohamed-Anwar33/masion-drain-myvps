# Order Processing System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Order Processing System for the Maison Darin backend with complete CRUD operations, validation, status management, and API endpoints.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Order Model (`models/Order.js`)
- **Complete Schema Definition**: Comprehensive order schema with multilingual support
- **Validation**: Robust field validation including customer info, items, and payment methods
- **Order Number Generation**: Unique order number generation with collision handling
- **Status Management**: Order and payment status tracking with validation
- **Stock Integration**: Methods to validate against product availability
- **Business Logic**: Methods for cancellation, refund eligibility, and status updates
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized indexes for common queries

**Key Features:**
- Multilingual product names (English/Arabic)
- Customer information validation (name, email, phone, address)
- Payment method validation (paypal, card, bank_transfer)
- Order status tracking (pending, confirmed, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- Payment status tracking (pending, completed, failed, refunded)
- Total validation against item prices
- Order number format: MD + timestamp + random (e.g., MD123456789012)

### 2. Order Service (`services/orderService.js`)
- **Order Creation**: Complete order creation with validation and stock checking
- **Order Management**: Get, update, cancel, confirm, and refund orders
- **Stock Management**: Automatic stock deduction and restoration
- **Validation**: Comprehensive order data and item validation
- **Statistics**: Order statistics and reporting
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and proper exception handling

**Key Methods:**
- `createOrder()`: Creates order with full validation and stock updates
- `getOrders()`: Retrieves orders with filtering and pagination
- `updateOrderStatus()`: Updates order or payment status
- `cancelOrder()`: Cancels order and restores stock
- `confirmOrder()`: Confirms pending orders
- `refundOrder()`: Processes refunds and stock restoration
- `getOrderStats()`: Provides order analytics

### 3. Order Controller (`controllers/orderController.js`)
- **RESTful API**: Complete REST API for order management
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- **Input Validation**: Request validation and sanitization
- **Response Formatting**: Consistent API response structure

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order
- `GET /api/orders` - Get orders with filtering/pagination
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - Get specific order
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/status` - Update order status
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/confirm` - Confirm order
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/cancel` - Cancel order
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/refund` - Refund order
- `GET /api/orders/stats` - Get order statistics
- `GET /api/orders/:id/refund-eligibility` - Check refund eligibility

### 4. Order Routes (`routes/orders.js`)
- **Authentication**: Protected admin routes with JWT authentication
- **Public Access**: Order creation available to customers
- **Route Organization**: Logical grouping of related endpoints
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive route documentation

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

#### Unit Tests (106 tests total)
- **Order Model Tests** (49 tests): Schema validation, instance methods, static methods
- **Order Service Tests** (29 tests): Business logic, validation, error handling
- **Order Controller Tests** (21 tests): HTTP handling, response formatting
- **Integration Tests** (7 tests): API endpoint testing, route validation

#### Test Coverage
- ✅ Schema validation and constraints
- ✅ Business logic and calculations
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ API endpoint functionality
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Database operations (mocked in unit tests)

## Integration with Existing System

### Database Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with existing MongoDB setup
- Proper indexing for performance optimization
- Consistent with existing model patterns

### Authentication Integration
- Uses existing JWT authentication middleware
- Proper role-based access control
- Public order creation, protected admin operations

### Product Integration
- Validates orders against product availability
- Automatic stock management
- Product reference validation

### Server Integration
- Added to main server routes
- Follows existing API patterns
- Consistent error handling

## API Usage Examples

### Create Order (Public)
```javascript
POST /api/orders
{
  "items": [{
    "product": "product_id",
    "quantity": 2,
    "price": 99.99,
    "name": {
      "en": "Luxury Perfume",
      "ar": "عطر فاخر"
    }
  }],
  "total": 199.98,
  "customerInfo": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York",
    "postalCode": "10001",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "paymentMethod": "card"
}
```

### Get Orders (Admin)
```javascript
GET /api/orders?page=1&limit=10&orderStatus=pending
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Update Order Status (Admin)
```javascript
PUT /api/orders/:id/status
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
{
  "status": "confirmed",
  "statusType": "order"
}
```

## Security Features
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication required for admin operations
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for large datasets
- Efficient aggregation queries for statistics
- Minimal data transfer with selective field returns

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error logging
- User-friendly error responses
- Graceful failure handling

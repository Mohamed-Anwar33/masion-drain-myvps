## üÜò Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Application Won't Start

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Verify all required variables are set
   node -e "require('./utils/validateEnv').validateEnv()"
   ```

2. **Check Database Connection**
   ```bash
   # Test MongoDB connection
   mongosh $MONGODB_URI --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"
   ```

3. **Check Port Availability**
   ```bash
   # Check if port is in use
   lsof -i :5000
   ```

#### High Response Times

1. **Check Database Performance**
   ```bash
   # Monitor database queries
   db.setProfilingLevel(2)
   db.system.profile.find().sort({ts: -1}).limit(5)
   ```

2. **Check Memory Usage**
   ```bash
   # Monitor memory usage
   pm2 monit
   ```

3. **Check Network Latency**
   ```bash
   # Test API response times
   curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s "http://localhost:5000/api/health"
   ```

#### Database Connection Issues

1. **Check MongoDB Status**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mongod
   ```

2. **Check Connection String**
   ```bash
   echo $MONGODB_URI
   ```

3. **Test Connection**
   ```bash
   mongosh $MONGODB_URI --eval "db.runCommand({ping: 1})"
   ```
